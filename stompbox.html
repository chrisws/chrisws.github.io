<p>I made this with google’s new App development tool called flutter.</p>
<p>What is a stomp box?</p>
<p>Wikipedia entry:</p>
<p><em>A stomp box (or stompbox) is a simple percussion instrument consisting of a small wooden box placed under the foot, which is tapped or stamped on rhythmically to produce a sound similar to that of a bass drum.</em></p>
<p><em>A stomp box allows a performer such as a singer or guitar player to create a simple rhythmic self-accompaniment.</em></p>
<p>How to use Stomp Box:</p>
<p>Press the stomp button four times to set the tempo and start playing. Press pause to stop playing. Press pause again to resume playing or press stomp to start a new tempo. Press KICK to change the bass drum sound. Press pattern to change the beat sequence.</p>
<p>If you want a real stomp box, I highly recommend the Peterman Puck’n Stompa !!!</p>
