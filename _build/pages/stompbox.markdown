### Introduction

Virtual stomp box/metronome

I made this with google's new App development tool called flutter. 

What is a stomp box? 

Wikipedia entry:

_A stomp box (or stompbox) is a simple percussion instrument consisting of a small wooden box placed under the foot, which is tapped or stamped on rhythmically to produce a sound similar to that of a bass drum._

_A stomp box allows a performer such as a singer or guitar player to create a simple rhythmic self-accompaniment._

How to use Stomp Box:

Press the stomp button four times to set the tempo and start playing. 
Press pause to stop playing. 
Press pause again to resume playing or press stomp to start a new tempo. 
Press KICK to change the bass drum sound. 
Press pattern to change the beat sequence.

If you want a real stomp box, I highly recommend the Peterman Puck'n Stompa !!!
