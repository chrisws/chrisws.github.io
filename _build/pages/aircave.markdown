### Introduction

To play this game you must be outside. The aim of the game is to find your way though a virtual maze.

You walk or run to set your position in the game with help from the android [location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_navigation) feature.

Along the way you collect coins and try to complete as many levels as you can before play time is over.

Please note, Air Cave does track your physical environment. It is your responsibility to play in a safe area.
