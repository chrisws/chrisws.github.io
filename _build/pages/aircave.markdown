### Introduction

Air Cave superimposes a maze over an outdoors playing area. The [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_navigation) feature on your android device gives your location in the maze.

You define the maze by pacing out the boundary of the playing area. You select each of the four corners of the maze by pressing the SET button on the setup screen.
